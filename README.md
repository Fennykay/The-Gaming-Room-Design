# The-Gaming-Room-Design

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
We were commisioned by The Gaming Room client to work on the design for expanding their game to other platforms. They already operated their game, "Draw it or Lose It", for Android but wanted to expand into a broader market. To do so, we had to consider the platforms and security options.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Taking each step as it was and not getting too caught into the overall scheme was key in productivity. Keeping everything as a bite sized piece made everything essential to continuing the pace. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would work on revising the recommendations section of it, I did not go as in depth with some things and could have given some more context to things. Things like security, fell short of full completion.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Taking the user's experience and needs is one of the most important thing to consider when making your application, they are what make or break you. You have to consider the average user when designing things, such as the operating system. The computer industry is largely dominated by windows, so it would make more sense to stick to that OS as they are comfortable with it and will reach a broader audience.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I often my first thought into what would be the most accomadating to the users experience. I would try to employee are more objective mindset in the future, as sometimes the best looking or easiest thing for the user is not always the best for the long term looks of the project.
